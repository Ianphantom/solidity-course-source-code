/*
Restricted Access to a Contract is a common practice. 

By Default, a contract state is read-only unless it is specified as public.

We can restrict who can modify the contract's state or call a contract's functions using modifiers. 

Let us build a contract with modified restricted access with the following common writeouts:

    onlyBy − only the mentioned caller can call this function.

    onlyAfter − called after certain time period.

    costs − call this function only if certain value is provided.


*/

contract RestrictedAcces {
    address public owner = msg.sender;
    uint256 public creationTime = block.timestamp;

    // write a modifier called onlyBy that will require the current caller to be equal to
    // an account address which we set as an input in the modifier and if
    // the requirement fails send a message that says - Sender not authorized!

    modifier onlyBy(address _account) {
        require(msg.sender == _account, "Sender not authorized!");
        _;
    }

    modifier onlyAfter(uint256 _time) {
        require(block.timestamp >= _time, "function is called too early!");
        _;
    }

    // write a function that will change the owner address
    function changeOwnerAddress(address _newAddress) public onlyBy(owner) {
        owner = _newAddress;
    }

    // write a function that can disown the current owner
    // only run the function 3 weeks or 5 seconds after the creation of the contract
    function disown() public onlyBy(owner) onlyAfter(creationTime + 5 weeks) {
        delete owner;
    }

    modifier costs(uint256 _amount) {
        require(msg.value >= _amount, "Not enough Ether provided");
        _;
    }

    function forceOwnerChange(address _newOwner)
        public
        payable
        costs(200 ether)
    {
        owner = _newOwner;
    }

    /*
    Exercise: 
    
    1. Create a modifier called costs which takes an _amount parameter
    2. Require that msg.value is greater than or equal to the amount 
    3. If the msg.value is not greather than or equal to the amount 
       return a string that says Not enough Ether provided. 
    4. Write a funciton called forceOwnerChange which takes an address called _newOwner and is payable 
    5. add a modification to the signature so that the function needs 200 ether to execute 
    6. set the owner of the contract to the new owner of the address.
    
    7. BONUS****** Figure out how to make the function actually run!
